All ‘undesirables’ such as Jews or African Americans were killed or fled west to either the neutral zone or the Japanese Pacific states. During this time several anti-Nazi paramilitaries popped up following a wide variety of ideologies from communist to black nationalism to a restoration of the old government. The country would eventually be led by Reichsmarschall John Smith who would manage to give America more autonomy from the Reich and would manage to gain full independence after assisting Wilhelm Goertzmann in replacing Führer Heinrich Himmler.<br> <br>\tDespite achieving independence Smith would continue to rule America as Reichsführer and would continue most of the policies started by the Nazis. He would also expand America westward occupying the neutral zone and planned to invade the newly formed Black California Republic before being assassinated by the American resistance. His successor, Bill Whitcroft, would call off the invasion of California and begin to implement democratic reforms. Now Whitcroft will attempt to forge a new Republic based on the days of old and will attempt to hold the first presidential elections in the past two decades. Several new political parties have formed with Whitcroft running under the nationalist American Union party who hope to keep some of the policies set by the Nazis. His main opposition will be from former resistance leader Wyatt Price running under the American Democratic party who wishes to implement huge democratic reforms and repeal most nazi policies. This election will influence which path the new nation will follow and will decide the fate of millions of people<br></div>","image_url":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*mMdA7ETxScGU4N7e8kl1HQ.jpeg","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/man-in-the-high-castle-tv-show-title-sequence.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":10,"year":1976,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1966"}];e.credits = "JochCapone on discord";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1001,"fields":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Whitcroft","election":10,"party":"American Union","state":"New York","priority":1,"description":"    Bill Whitcroft to most is seen as a typical Nazi party member loyal to the Führer till the end.

After the death of John Smith and the restoration of democracy under Bill Whitcroft, Price would begin to reorganize the American Resistance movement into a political organization called the American Democratic Party which would call for the furthering of reforms and denazification of the country. Despite this, the party is deeply divided with moderates wanting simply a return of the old constitution while more radical elements call for a more leftist constitution.
